<h1 class="ab">About Tesla</h1> <hr>



    <h1 class="tr"> Tesla’s mission is to accelerate  the world’s transition to sustainable energy.</h1> 
    <P class="cutti">
Tesla was founded in 2003 by a group of engineers who wanted to prove that people didn’t need to compromise to drive <br> electric – that electric vehicles can be better, quicker and more fun to drive than gasoline cars. Today, Tesla builds not only <br> all-electric vehicles but also infinitely scalable clean energy generation and storage products. Tesla believes the faster the <br> world stops relying on fossil fuels and moves towards a zero-emission future, the better.

Launched in 2008, the Roadster<br>  unveiled Tesla’s cutting-edge battery technology and electric powertrain.From there,  Tesla designed the world’s first ever <br> premium all-electric sedan from the ground up – Model S – which has become the best car  in its class in every category.<br> Combining safety, performance, and efficiency, Model S has reset the world’s expectations for the car of the 21st century <br>with the longest range of any electric  vehicle, over-the-air software updates that make it better over time, and a record <br> 0-60 mph acceleration time of 2.28 seconds as measured by Motor Trend. In 2015, Tesla expanded its product line with <br> Model X, the safest, quickest and most  capable sport utility vehicle in history that holds 5-star safety ratings across every <br> category from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Completing CEO  Elon Musk’s “Secret Master Plan,”<br> in 2016, Tesla introduced Model 3, a low-priced, high-volume electric  vehicle that began production in 2017. Soon after,<br> Tesla unveiled the safest, most comfortable truck  ever – Tesla Semi – which is designed to save owners at least $200,000 <br> over a million miles based on fuel costs alone. In 2019, Tesla unveiled Model Y, a mid-size SUV, with seating for up to seven,<br> and Cybertruck, which will have better utility than a traditional truck  and more performance than a sports car.

Tesla vehicles <br> are produced at its factory in Fremont, California, and Gigafactory Shanghai. To achieve our  goal of having the safest factories <br>in the world, Tesla is taking a proactive approach to safety, requiring production employees to participate in a multi-day training<br> program before  ever setting foot on the factory floor. From there, Tesla continues to provide on-the-job training and track performance <br> daily so that improvements can be made quickly. The result is that Tesla’s safety rate continues to improve while production ramps.
<br>
To create an entire sustainable energy ecosystem, Tesla also manufactures a unique set of energy solutions,  Powerwall, Powerpack <br>and Solar Roof, enabling homeowners, businesses, and utilities to manage renewable energy generation, storage, and consumption.<br> Supporting Tesla’s automotive and  energy products is Gigafactory 1 – a facility designed to significantly reduce battery cell costs. <br> By bringing cell production in-house, Tesla manufactures batteries at the volumes required to meet production goals, while creating<br> thousands of jobs. 

And this is just the beginning. With Tesla building its most affordable car yet, Tesla continues to make products accessible <br> and affordable to more and more people, ultimately  accelerating the advent of clean transport and clean energy production. Electric cars,<br> batteries, and renewable energy generation  and storage already exist independently, but when combined, they become even more powerful<br> – that’s the future we want.</P>
